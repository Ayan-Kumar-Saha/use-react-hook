# 🧰 use react hook

A collection of custom React hooks to sharpen your skills — from **basic to advanced**. Each hook solves a real-world problem and is written with reusability in mind.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is a list of important react hooks along with code to practice hands-on implementation. While it's built for my own learning, others are welcome to explore and practice with these hooks.

⚠️ Note: This project has no affiliation with usehooks.com and is not intended as a replacement or alternative. If you're looking for production-ready hooks, please use the well-maintained [usehooks](https://usehooks.com/) instead.

I currently have no plans to release this as a library, since useHooks already exist. That said, if time permits, I might turn this into a full-featured interactive playground for learning and demoing.
